# Python_With_IIEC
Under the guidance of our respected Vimal Daga sir, Preeti mam and IIEC_RISE platform i have made a python virtual assistant which will be solving some of the user cases:-

This is a user friendly virtual assistant which can assist users in launching some of the most used popular application softwares and perform various tasks listed below:-

Sublime text editor,
Window media player,
Visual studio code,
Notepad,
Send whatsapp message,
Send email,
Date,
Chrome,
Latest news,
Entertainment me,
Play music,
Dictionary.

When opening chrome user's will have opportunity to go directly on some widely used website's or open user desired website even before opening chrome.

User can read news , send whatsapp message and even emails. Music can be played and words can be searched for their meanings. User can have a look on the weather.

If a user is feeling bored he will be shown some interesting and random facts which will increase his knowledge with a spark of fun element.

I will be more than happy if you would try my project and give me proper guidance for future.
